# wcftp

PS Module that uses dotnet webclient class for ftp communication. 

# notes

I recommend using the [winscp module](https://github.com/dotps1/WinSCP). This logic was built up over time in some scripts I use and so I migrated it all into a module so some legacy jobs would continue to function unchanged. As I already used winscp for some other situations, I eventually consolidated onto just using winscp, but wanted to include this module in case anyone else ever needed it, or at least needed to see how someone might do ftp with webclient.
